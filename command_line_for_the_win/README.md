To connect to a server using SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol), you typically follow these steps:

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**
   - On Linux or macOS, you can use the Terminal.
   - On Windows, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell.

2. **Run the SFTP Command:**
   - Use the `sftp` command along with the username and hostname of the server.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     sftp username@hostname
     ```

3. **Enter Password:**
   - You will be prompted to enter your password for the specified username.

4. **Navigate to the Desired Directory:**
   - Once connected, you can navigate to the directory on the remote server where you want to upload or download files.
   - Use `cd` to change directories.

5. **Upload Files to the Server:**
   - To upload files from your local machine to the server, use the `put` command.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     put local_file.txt
     ```

6. **Download Files from the Server:**
   - To download files from the server to your local machine, use the `get` command.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     get remote_file.txt
     ```

7. **Close the SFTP Session:**
   - Once you've finished transferring files, you can exit the SFTP session.
   - Use the `exit` or `quit` command.

Here's a summary of the commands you might use within the SFTP session:

- `ls` or `dir`: List files in the current remote directory.
- `cd`: Change the remote directory.
- `put`: Upload files from the local machine to the server.
- `get`: Download files from the server to the local machine.
- `exit` or `quit`: Close the SFTP session.

Remember to replace `username` and `hostname` with your actual username and the hostname or IP address of the server. Additionally, some servers might require SSH key authentication instead of a password. In such cases, you would need to have an SSH key pair and configure the server to accept your public key
